# Bulk Save Tool for Wordpress

This tool is for developers and is useful for running tasks that happen when a post is updated. In and of itself it does nothing but update each post with no additional data. However if using a plugin like Import External Images is installed. It's actions will be executed on each post. When using this tool, you are essentially clicking update on every post.
